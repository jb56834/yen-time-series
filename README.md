# A Yen for the Future

## Time-Series Forecasting
According to the time series analysis and modeling in the python notebook, 

**Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?**
Forecasts based on the time-series analysis show that yen price will increase yet with a downward return rate and upward volatilty. Risk of the yen is expected to increase in short term. Given higher volatility and lower return, I would not buy yen now.

**Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?**
Risk of the yen is expected to increase in short term. 

**Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?**
When evaluating ARMA, ARIMA and GARCH models, I do not see they meet p-value threshold for all their lags to reject null hypothesis. ThusI am not confident in using them for trading.


## Linear Regression Forecasting

According to the results of the linear regression analysis and modeling in the python notebook, 
Out-of-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):0.4154832784856737 </br>
In-Sample Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):0.5963660785073426

**Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?**
This model performs better on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data.
